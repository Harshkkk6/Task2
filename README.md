# Task2
Sure! Here's a professional and informative **GitHub README description** for **Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in your project:

---

## 📊Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🎯 Objective
The goal of this task is to develop a deeper understanding of the dataset through statistics and visualizations. By uncovering patterns, trends, anomalies, and relationships between features, we set the foundation for better feature engineering and model selection in upcoming tasks.

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and summary statistics  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for static visualizations (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps)  
- **Plotly** – for interactive plots

---

### 📋 Key Steps Performed

1. **Summary Statistics**
   - Computed basic descriptive statistics like `mean`, `median`, `standard deviation`, `min`, `max`, and `percentiles` for all numerical features.
   - Checked for null values and feature distributions.

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Plotted **histograms** to understand the distribution of numerical variables.
   - Used **boxplots** to detect outliers and spread of data.

3. **Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis**
   - Created **pairplots** to visualize relationships between key numeric features.
   - Generated a **correlation matrix heatmap** to examine feature interdependencies.

4. **Pattern and Anomaly Detection**
   - Identified skewed distributions, missing value patterns, and possible data entry issues.
   - Highlighted outliers and their potential impact on downstream tasks.

5. **Initial Insights & Inferences**
   - Noted key trends and relationships that might affect the target variable.
   - Identified potential features for transformation, scaling, or encoding.

---

### 📌 Outcome
This EDA task provided critical insights into the structure and quality of the data. These findings will directly influence data cleaning, preprocessing, and model selection decisions in the next stages.
